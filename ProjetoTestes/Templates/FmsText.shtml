FMS helps to identify strengths and limitations in fundamental movement. Each screen is scored between a 3 (perfect) to 0 (pain was experienced).Higher scores in a particular screen indicate where you have a greater potential for success with related training exercises. Lower scores indicate areas where you can focus on improving your ability to move in order to become a better athlete and reduce injury.<br />
<p>Scoring Guide: 3 = Completed perfectly, 2 = Ability to complete movement but with some level of compensation, 1 = Could not complete the movement, 0 = Pain was experienced</p>
